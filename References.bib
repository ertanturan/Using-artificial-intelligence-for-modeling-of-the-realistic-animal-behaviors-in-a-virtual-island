   abstract = {The paper describes a scheme in which a fuzzy algorithm is used to control plant, in this case, a laboratory-built steam engine. The algorithm is implemented as an interpreter of a set of rules expressed as fuzzy conditional statements. This implementation on a digital computer is used online, to control the plant. The merit of such a controller is discussed in the light of the results obtained.},
