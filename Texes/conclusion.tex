In this paper, a fuzzy-logic based artificial intelligence created to control animals  in a simulation environment. As explained and shown by the project itself and its results, its possible to create such an environment which based on nature in visual environment-simulation. Thu rules are created according to nature's prey-hunter relation to make the decisions more realistic. All of the rules makes the whole system think about environmental situations and decide how to act by its own. The action states show different programming algorithms developed to make real-oriented (or nature-oriented) simulation system. Its also developed for this kind of project to show how its vitally important the usage of rules and create logical connections between each other. If there is a missing point in the system the animal will not know what to do. Its impossible to have such a situation in nature itself . Also, good structure of a rule base will reduce the time consumption for development.


As humanity inspired from nature for centuries , we can still inspired by nature for the future of science and to solve more problem efficiently.
