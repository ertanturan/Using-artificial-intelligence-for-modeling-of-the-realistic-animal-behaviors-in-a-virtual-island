This article introduces the use of fuzzy logic to create AI animals which have various behavior types from an eagle’s perspective  which called ‘Flight Simulation’ .The simulation presents a flying object what we call as an eagle over the airspace of an island . The AI’s on the ground realizes the other animals from a clear distant behaving  according to the other animal’s distance,speed and status of aggression . Also, there is non-AI sparrow herd placed over the island to make user understand how fast he is and give the user sense of speed what can be called as an in-project feature .  The project extended with Arduino Uno connected to Gyro(6-Axis) on a breadboard to give total control of the eagle  to the user .
