Along with the last decades computer science technologies boosted it’s capabilities with increasing acceleration .  Hence , today our computers are capable of providing better graphic qualities and making more complex calculations . But thanks to the current technology, game graphics are processed by separate graphics processors (GPUs) providing an enormous power for AI \cite{gpu_negnev}. According to that  all this games ,simulations and AI’s has became an indispensable part of our daily lives and there is considerable amount of related products appeared.

Good computer and video games like System Shock 2, Deus Ex, Pikmin, Rise of Nations, Neverwinter Nights, and Xenosaga: Episode 1 are learning machines . They get themselves learned and learned well, so that they get played long and hard by a great many people. This is how they and their designers survive and perpetuate themselves \cite{challenge} . It's the biggest purpose why people are eager to use AI's in their games.Artificial intelligence (AI) is typically defined as “the scientific understanding of the mechanisms underlying thought and intelligent behaviour and their embodiment in machines” \cite{ai} . That scientific mechanism is widely used to have realistic behaviours in games and simulations . 

There are various way to creating behaviours with AI such as , Expert Systems , Neural Networks and Fuzzy Logic Systems -or Implements - .The expert systems are the computer applications developed to solve complex problems in a particular domain, at the level of extra-ordinary human intelligence and expertise.Yet another research area in AI, neural networks, is inspired from the natural - Biology-  neural network of human nervous system . The inventor of ANN (Artificial Neural Networks) Dr. Robert Hecht-Nielsen defines it as "...a computing system made up of a number of simple, highly interconnected processing elements, which process information by their dynamic state response to external inputs  " \cite{ann} . The last method and research area of  is Fuzzy Logic (FL) . The approach of Fuzzy-Logic resembles the way of decision making in humans that involves all  possibilities between digital values 1  and 0 . A widely known mistake is to see Fuzzy-Logic just to create and design human-like behaviours . But , with different types of algorithms like fleeing , cowardly and swarm you can easily use that methodology to create animal-like behaviours of any kind of animal .

Fuzzy Logic is not widely used in this way especially in games or shooting/hunting simulations . Mostly AI's implemented in other ways . But , this paper presents a simulation which contains AI (FL-based) implemented animals . The rest of the paper is structured as follows : Section II \textit{Materials And Methods} presents the used materials,hardwares and methods to make clear the capabilities of the project . Also, includes some information about the environment .   Section III \textit{Fuzy-Logic And Fuzzy Set Theory} gives a brief the fuzzy-logic and demonstrates how it works with basic examples. Section IV explains the fuzzy-logic system created \& used in the project which represented by this paper..
